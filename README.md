# Arch Snowflake:

> "Storage, Query Processing, Cloud Services." 

Snowflake's architecture is built on three primary layers: 
* Storage for managing data 
* Query processing for executing computations
* cloud services for orchestrating and coordinating operations, including security and access control.
  
These layers are fundamental to understanding Snowflake's functionality and design.

> ACCOUNTADMIN or SECURITYADMIN are the only able to see the existing warehouses. ACCOUNTADMIN can also create new ones, nonetheless, SECURITYADMIN no

> SYSADMIN can create Warehouses but not see the existent unless they are associated with this role. SYSADMIN is the role intended to create Warehouses

# Data Warehouse
A Data Warehouse (DW) is a database that consolidates and integrates data from multiple sources into a single, consumable system. Its purpose is to optimize this data for reporting and data analysis, providing a unified and reliable foundation for decision-making.
